# CleanitApp
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
An app that helps in cleanup of local areas on a volunteering basis.<br>
These 'clean ups' include removing rubbish from public places like beaches, parks, tourist sites and more.<br>
Users can upload images of the messed up places (and a small description) & add the location of the area requiring a cleanup. Also an approximate of the total volunteers is needed. The area will then be highlighted on a map with a unique color based on the intensity of the impact (like red, orange, yellow). 
Volunteers can then look for locations around them and choose to participate in these cleanup activities. <br>
Once done, the cleanup task for that area will be marked as completed.
